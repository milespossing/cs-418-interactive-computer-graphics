1. V true distance is sqrt...
2. V near plane wws maps to z=−wz=−w and far plane ww maps to z=wz=w
  ~ near plane w's maps to z = -1
3. V
  the z-buffer algorithm can compute the wrong result when triangles are almost co-planar
  the z-buffer algorithm can compute the wrong result when there are transparent triangles
  the painter's algorithm can make the scene more complicated, with more triangles than the artist created
  ~the painter's algorithm can compute the wrong result when triangles are almost co-planar
  ~the painter's algorithm can compute the wrong result when triangles intersect
4. V 99
5. X
  ~ 99
6. V any matched pair 
  ~ near-w < z
  ~ all six
  ~ both near and far
7. V Opacity
8. V All but ~
  ~ require more complicated algorithms than point-like pixels do
  reduce or remove the stair step edges point-like pixels have
  fully remove gaps between abutting triangles area-like pixels have
  require more memory than point-like pixels do
  require more memory than area-like pixels do
9. V an optimization yielding a constant factor speedup
