Need basic game state frame loop:

1. Initialize game state
2. Begin game loop:
  1. Check user inputs
  2. increment state s with inputs into s'
  3. Render gamestate s'


Game state

- Player location
- Player View [20]
- Movement mode (vehicular movement) [15]

- Need some kind of nice way to rotate player view in the state transformation
