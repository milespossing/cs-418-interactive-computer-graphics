Plan

Required:
[] start with simple geometry
  [] need view
  [] need lighting
[] Get Terrain running in toy example
[] Set up UI for configurability

Optional (55):
[x] Shiny (10)
[x] Height-based color ramp (20) ((30))
[x] Rocky Cliffs (20) ((50))

[] fix the height in the vertex shader

Because there may or may not be a different geometry for the torus, I
need some way to selectively set up the geometry. Whatever I do for
required 0 I should make sure that I keep that in the final product.

Because the rocky cliffs must have a different material, I should ensure
that it is easy for me to select materials based on some criteria (that
might be very difficult, I don't know)
